<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Troy Edmonds. I was born and raised in Virginia, with strong roots in various parts of Maryland and the D.C. area. 
I grew up in a single-parent household where I learned the importance of hard work, patience and mental toughness, which have become my secret weapons in every job I take on.

<p>I am currently working towards my dream of breaking into the tech industry. 
My journey through customer service and retail has taught me valuable soft skills that employers are looking for. I am not just a worker; I am a quick learner, and I believe that nothing is beyond my grasp if I put my mind to it.</p>

<p>In addition to my self-taught path to software development, I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics certification, which has further enhanced my abilities in this field.</p>
